                    <p>Founded in 1824, The <b>Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution </b> (also known as
                        <b>BRLSI</b>) , is an independant educational charity exhibition based in Bath, England. <br>
                        This website is dedicated into recreating the old Institution building. <br>
                        Using the little resources that we were given, we have recreated it within a virtual
                        environment. <br>
                        These also includes the multiple artifacts that we've recreated with the help of photogrammetry.
                        Enjoy the
                        experience!
